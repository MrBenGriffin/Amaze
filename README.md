Simple fun learning project.

```By Ben & Tay```

## So far:
Some basic classes have been written.
These include 'wall' and 'cell', as well as some trivial
enums.

main.py also is being used to test them out. 
Currently I'm not planning on adding unit tests. 
Maybe one day.

## Todo:
We should have a graphic front-end at some point.


###Novelty fun: 
Total extra - add 'power runes'.
A rune can be used just once to open a rune-door.
One can carry only one rune at a time.
Running over a rune picks it up, (and drops off any currently held)

Rune-doors: Are they opened once opened, or do they allow a single transit?
