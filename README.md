Simple fun learning project.

```By Ben & Tay```

## So far:

main.py also is being used to test them out. 
Currently I'm not planning on adding unit tests. 
Maybe one day.

## Todo:
We should have a graphic front-end at some point.
So, out of basic simple reasons, I chose tkinter.

!(maze.png)

We need a mover class - with two subclasses:
Digger/Miner    - who constructs the maze (and leaves runes lying around)
Adventurer      - who travels through the maze interactively.
Robot           - who travels through the maze. automatically.

## Novelty fun: 
Total extra - add 'power runes'.
A rune can be used just once to open a rune-door.
One can carry only one rune at a time.
Running over a rune picks it up, (and drops off any currently held)

Rune-doors: Are they opened once opened, or do they allow a single transit?
